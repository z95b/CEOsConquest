CEO's Conquest is a turn-based digital board game in Unity where a single player navigates a corporate dungeon, moving one tile per turn and battling NPCs based on power probabilities.

# Introduction
CEO's Conquest is a digital board game where players navigate through a fictional company turned dungeon. They start their adventure in the lobby and progress through various departments. Each tile on the board represents a department, where players can encounter threats, benefits, fellow adventurers, or business enemies, leading up to a final battle against the CEO, Mr. Vathrax. The game blends humor, strategy, and RPG elements for a unique experience.

Imagine a large, eerie mansion with many rooms and corridors. Players start in the 'Lobby,' the starting point. The main goal is to reach the 'Final' where they will face a formidable boss. Along the way, they encounter various rooms. Some, like the 'Casino,' allow players to play games of chance for rewards, while others, like the 'Dead End,' present dangerous challenges.

Each player chooses their character and starts at level 3. They have options like the shop, where they can buy useful items with the money earned during the adventure, and the inventory, where they can see their items and progress. Players must move through different rooms and face various monsters. Each turn, monsters and the boss move through the dungeon. Additionally, there is a 'Random Button' element that occasionally activates and can cause unexpected or amusing actions.

The game continues until a player defeats the formidable final boss. During their adventure, they may find special items like magic weapons or potions to aid them in their quest. This is all depicted on a simple 2D board where the standout features are the characters, chosen by the players, and the monsters, which are transformed into business executives with the final boss being the CEO.
